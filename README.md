Complex numbers

A math teacher needs a program that helps students to perform different operations with
complex numbers. The program manages several complex numbers (defined as ADT) and
allows students to use the following features offered by the program:

1. Simple operations with a complex number:

 Determine the cartesian form (real part and imaginary part) of a complex number
 If c1 = 3 + 4i, then real = 3 and imag = 4
 
  Determine the polar form (modulus and argument) of a complex number
 If c1 = 3 + 4i, then modulus = 5 and argument = 53.13⁰ (or 0.93 radians) or c1 = 5(cos(53.13⁰ ) + i sin(53.13⁰ ))
 
  Determine the complex conjugate of a complex number
 If c1 = 3 + 4i, then 𝑐̅1 = 3 - 4i
 
  Multiply a complex number by a real number
 If c1 = 3 + 4i, and x = 3, then c1 * x = 9 + 12i
 
  Multiply a complex number by an imaginary number
 If c1 = 3 + 4i, and im = 3i, then c1 * im = -12 + 9i
 
 
2. Operations involving 2 complex numbers:

 Add two complex numbers
 c1 = 3 + 4i, c2 = 3 - 2i, then sum is s = 6 + 2i
 
 Multiply two complex numbers
c1 = 3 + 4i, c2 = 3 - 2i, then product is p = 17 + 6i


3. Complex operations on a single complex number:

 Determine the matrix representation of a complex number
 c1 = 3 + 4i -> 
(3 −4
 4 3)

 Powers of a complex number
 If c1 = 3 + 4i, and p = 3, then (c1)p = -81 + 92i
 
 Square root of a complex number
 If c1 = 3 + 4i, then √𝑐1 = 2 + i = 2.23(cos(26.56⁰ ) + i sin(26.56⁰ ))
 
 Exponential of a complex number
 If c1 = 3 + 4i, then exp(c1) = -13.12 - 15.2 i = 20.08(cos(-130.817⁰ ) + i sin(-130.817⁰ ))
